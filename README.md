It would be cool if users of a system could define their own models and then
use them.  Imagine an inventory system.  You could provide a way for users to
define new items so you don't have to anticipate everything up front.


TODO

Handle instances.  We've got models, but how do we store instances with their
instance values?

Does this handle arrays already (multiple image urls for example)?
